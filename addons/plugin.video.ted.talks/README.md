xbmc-plugin.video.ted.talks
---------------------------
This is a fork of the project started by rwparris, see [here](http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=36866).

For installation instructions see [Installing](https://github.com/moreginger/xbmc-plugin.video.ted.talks/wiki/Installing)

The goal is (_surprise_) to allow watching TED talks in XBMC.
It currently supports a few limited browsing options:
* Newest talks
* Speakers
* Themes
* Favorites (if you provide your TED credentials)

In addition it can show subtitles for a talk.

Subtitle language
-----------------
The plugin attempts to fetch subtitles in the current XBMC language.

Alternatively a _custom language code_ (ISO639-1) can be entered in the addon settings.

It is also possible to enter a comma separated list of language codes (e.g. _pt-br,pt,en_)
which will show subtitles in the first language which matches.
